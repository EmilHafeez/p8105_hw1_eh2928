#Starting Small

This is an R Markdown file I'm creating for P8105. I focus on meaningful naming schemas, readable code, clearly-written explanatory text, and parsimony. 

#Problem 1

We create a data frame which contains a random sample of size 10 from a Gaussian distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor levels. 

```{r}
#Load and use tibble to create aforementioned data frame

library(tidyverse)
practice_df = tibble(
    vec_rnorm_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_greater_than_zero_logical = (vec_rnorm_numeric > 0), 
    vec_building_characters = c("Will", "I", "always", "get", "a", "headache", "from", "thinking", "too", "hard"),
    vec_factor_temperature = factor(c("Fahrenheit", "Fahrenheit", "Celsius", "Fahrenheit", "Kelvin", "Fahrenheit", "Celsius", "Kelvin", "Kelvin", "Fahrenheit"))
)
```
