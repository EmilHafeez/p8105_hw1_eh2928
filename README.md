Assignment 1 for P8105, due 9/19/2020

I'm creating an Rmd file linked with version control to a GitHub repository titled 'p8105_hw1_eh2928'. 

The file is useful beginner's practice for me: establishing a connection with GitHub and establishing good habits, as well as creating and manipulating some data (including a data frame, changing data type, and more). It also examines basic data exploration, in-line code, and some ggplot basics.

It uses a novel dataset I create using tibble(), and then the "penguins" dataset from the "palmerpenguins" package. 

It requires these as well as library(tidyverse).
